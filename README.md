# Swingy
This is a project from the Java world at 42. I learned to develop GUI applications with the SWING framework, in order to create an RPG game.
Usage:
1. Build the project running the command ($mvn clean package) in the root of your project folder.
This needs to generate a runnable .jar file that can launch the game
2. The game can be launched in 2 modes
  ($java -jar swingy.jar console)
  ($java -jar swingy.jar gui)
